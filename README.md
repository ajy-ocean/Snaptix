## Overview
Snaptix is a microservices-based backend for a ticket booking platform. It manages ticket inventory, user bookings, and order processing, ensuring scalability and reliability through modern tools and patterns.

## Inventory Service
The Inventory Service manages ticket stock for events, supporting CRUD operations to track ticket availability and integrating with other services for accurate inventory data.

## DB Migration with Flyway
Flyway handles database schema management, enabling versioned migrations for consistent database setups across development, testing, and production environments.

## Booking Service
The Booking Service processes user ticket reservations, coordinating with the Inventory Service to verify ticket availability and manage booking requests.

## Kafka
Apache Kafka enables event-driven communication between microservices, supporting asynchronous messaging for ticket bookings, inventory updates, and order processing to enhance scalability.

## Order Service
The Order Service handles customer orders, integrating with the Inventory and Booking Services to create, update, and track ticket purchase orders.

## API Gateway Service
The API Gateway serves as the entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate microservices while handling load balancing, authentication, and request preprocessing.

## Spring Security with Keycloak
Spring Security, integrated with Keycloak, secures the application by managing user authentication and authorization with role-based access control for users and administrators.

## Circuit Breaker Pattern with Resilience4j
Resilience4j implements the Circuit Breaker pattern to handle service failures, ensuring system robustness with fallback mechanisms during outages.

## API Documentation with Swagger
Swagger generates interactive API documentation, allowing developers and clients to explore and test the application's endpoints easily.

## Expanding This Project and Next Steps
Future enhancements include:
- Support for multiple event types
- Integration with payment gateways
- Performance optimization
- Advanced analytics for booking trends
